<h2> BOARD GAMES</h2>
</div>
<h3>Board games are traditionally a subset of tabletop games that involve counters or pieces moved or placed on a pre-marked surface or "board", according to a set of rules.Some games are based on pure strategy, but many contain an element of chance; and some are purely chance, with no element of skill.Games usually have a goal that a player aims to achieve. Early board games represented a battle between two armies, and most modern board games are still based on defeating opponents in terms of counters, winning position, or accrual of points.There are many varieties of board games.</h3>
